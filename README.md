# Wonder Tix
Wonder Tix is an in-progress ticket sales software developed in collaboration with Portland Playhouse. 

## Project setup
1. `git clone` the repo
2. `npm install`
3. Create the PostgreSQL DB using the create statements in [`sql-scripts/create_tables.sql`](/sql-scripts/create_tables.sql)
4. Download the [stripe cli](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to the project root directory 
	(change the `stripe` script in [package.json](/package.json) if using linux/mac)
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill out the appropriate fields:
```
PRIVATE_STRIPE_KEY = ...
PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY = ...
PGHOST = ...
PGPORT = ...
PGUSER = ...
PGPASSWORD = ...
PGDATABASE = ...
```
You can find your Stripe API keys in the [developers section on the stripe website](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)

6. Insert an admin into the `users` table using [bcrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/) to generate a password hash
7. `npm run start`

## Connecting Stripe to hosted version of the app: 

If this project is being hosted and has a working endpoint url, you can set up webhooks directly in your stripe account on the stripe website.
Go to the [webhook section on the Stripe site](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/create) and fill out the requested information to have requests sent to the server whenever a selected event occurs.
While testing, we listened for the events "payment_intent.succeeded" and "charge.refunded" for adding tickets to the db and initiating refunds.
